        "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.<br>\n",
        "Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either.This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.<br>\n",
        "Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n",
        "Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).<br>\n",
        "If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.<br>\n",
